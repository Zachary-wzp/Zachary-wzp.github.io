## Project Contribution
* Field research.
* Conduct building performance simulations based on Grasshopper (Ladybug & Honeybee).
* Implement multi-objective optimization based on Grasshopper (Octopus).
* Analyze the impact of thermal bridges generated by joint tolerances in prefabricated buildings on the indoor environment based on COMSOL.
* Implement linear thermal transmittance sensitivity analysis and develop linear thermal transmittance prediction models based on machine learning (Python).
